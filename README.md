# iOS Weather

A lightweight, framework‑free weather dashboard that mirrors the clean look of Apple’s Weather app. Built with HTML 5, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it consumes the public OpenWeatherMap REST API to display current conditions, an 8‑hour forecast, a 5‑day forecast, and key metrics such as UV index, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.

## Features

- Current weather with high and low temperatures
- Scrollable 8‑hour hourly forecast
- 5‑day forecast displaying icons and min/max temperatures
- UV index, wind speed, humidity, and visibility cards
- Fully responsive layout (mobile to desktop)
- Dynamic gradient background that adapts to weather and time of day
- Graceful loading and error states
- No build step is required—just open index.html in any modern browser.
